Made a production-ready number guessing game with edge case handling and learned about:

1-  How to use the ternary operator.
2-  We cannot use break inside a ternary operator â€” it always returns a value.
3-  How to clear the screen using the os module.
4- 'nt' is the OS name for Windows; 'cls' is used for clearing the screen on Windows, and 'clear' for Linux/Mac.
5-  Handling edge cases properly.
