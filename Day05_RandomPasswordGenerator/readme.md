Created a Password Generator in Python where users choose letters, symbols, and digits.

#key takeaways-
# random.shuffle() can be used to shuffle the string.
# list.append() can be used to add item in list
# random.choice() can be used to select a random item in string
# print(var,end="") can be used to print variable without nextline
# range(a,b) can be used as a arithmatic progression //a,a+1,a+2,...,b-1  'a' is inclusive and 'b' is exclusive
# for var_name in list:
# do something
# //it works like foreach loop
